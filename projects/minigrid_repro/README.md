# Scalable oversight for a gridworld RL agent

This code produced the gridworld RL results in the paper. The core functionality is divided between these scripts:
* `grid.py` - implements the `ContinuingEnv` gridworld environment.
* `agents.py` - implements the policy networks, loss calculation, and gradient routing; central object is the `RoutedPolicyNetwork`.
* `training.py` - trains agents in the environment, key functions are the reward functions and `train()`.
* `bulk_runs.py` - orchestrates calls to `train()` with different settings; this shows how different algorithms are configured.

All scripts starting with `analyze_*` are used to read CSV files generated by `bulk_runs.py` and produce summary statistics.
